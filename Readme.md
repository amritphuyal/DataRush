Data for competition should be in the form of csv file at 'data' folder

| File           | Decription                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| train.csv      | Training dataset containing id, abstract, category and category_num                                         |
| validation.csv | Validation dataset containing id, abstract, category and category_num                                       |
| test.csv       | The testing dataset contains id, abstract. The competitors are required to predict category_num             |
| labels.csv     | Map of the category to category_num                                                                         |
| sample.csv     | The sample solution file. The id column is the same as of test.csv category_num is to the predicted output. |


The solution file should be named `solution.csv` and the format is the same as `sample.csv`
